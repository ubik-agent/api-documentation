Welcome to the UBIK API Reference. This documentation provides detailed information about all the available endpoints, parameters, and responses.

For more goal-oriented tutorials and step-by-step guides, please see our [Guides section](/en/index).

## Authentication

All requests to the UBIK API must be authenticated. Authentication is handled by providing your secret API key in the `X-API-KEY` header of every request.

You can find and manage your API keys in the UBIK dashboard under your user settings.

```bash cURL
-H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Tip>
  Keep your API key secure as if it were a password and do not expose it in any client-side code.
</Tip>

## API Endpoint

The base URL for all API endpoints is:

```
https://app.ubik-agent.com/api/v1
```
