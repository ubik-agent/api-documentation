Welcome to the UBIK API Reference. This documentation provides detailed information about all the available endpoints, parameters, and responses.

For more goal-oriented tutorials and step-by-step guides, please see our [Guides section](/en/index).

## Authentication

All requests to the UBIK API must be authenticated. We support two primary methods:

1.  **API Key (Server-Side)**: For backend integrations.
2.  **Scoped JWT (Client-Side)**: For frontend applications and multi-tenant user isolation.

For a complete guide on authentication, generating tokens, and managing multi-tenancy with `external_user_id`, please see our [Authentication & Security Guide](/en/guides/authentication).

## API Endpoint

The base URL for all API endpoints is:

```
https://app.ubik-agent.com/api/v1
