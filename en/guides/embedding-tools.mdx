Embedding UBIK tools into your own application provides a powerful way to extend your product's capabilities. This guide will walk you through the process of securely embedding a tool using an `<iframe>`.

<Steps>

<Step title="Configure Allowed Origins">
  To prevent unauthorized domains from embedding your tools, you must first configure a list of **Allowed Origins** for your API key. This is a critical security step. An "origin" is the combination of a protocol, domain, and port (e.g., `https://yourapp.com`).

  You can set the allowed origins for your API keys in the user settings page on the UBIK dashboard.

  <Note>
  For local development, you can add origins like `http://localhost:3000`. For production, ensure you only add the domains where your application is hosted.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Fetch Embedding Information">
  Before you can render the `<iframe>`, your application's frontend needs to fetch the embedding details from the UBIK API. This is done by making a `GET` request to the `/tools/{tool_id}/embed-info` endpoint.

  This endpoint provides two crucial pieces of information:
  1.  **Tool Details**: The schema, name, description, etc.
  2.  **Access Token**: A short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) that the embedded `<iframe>` will use to authenticate itself.

  <CodeGroup title="GET /tools/{tool_id}/embed-info">
  ```bash cURL
  curl -X GET "https://app.ubik-agent.com/api/v1/tools/YOUR_TOOL_ID/embed-info" \
       -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```
  ```python Python (Server-Side)
  import requests

  api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
  tool_id = "YOUR_TOOL_ID"
  
  headers = {"X-API-KEY": api_key}
  
  # This call would typically be made from your server, which then passes
  # the embed info to your frontend client.
  response = requests.get(
      f"https://app.ubik-agent.com/api/v1/tools/{tool_id}/embed-info",
      headers=headers
  )

  if response.status_code == 200:
      embed_info = response.json()
      print(embed_info)
      # Pass this info to your frontend
  else:
      print(f"Error: {response.status_code}", response.text)
  ```
  ```javascript JavaScript (Client-Side)
  // This function would typically call an endpoint on YOUR server, 
  // which then makes the secure call to the UBIK API with your secret API key.
  
  async function fetchEmbedInfoFromServer(toolId) {
    try {
      // Example: an endpoint on your own backend
      const response = await fetch(`/api/get-tool-embed-info?toolId=${toolId}`);
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);
      }
      const embedInfo = await response.json();
      console.log(embedInfo);
      // Use this data to render the iframe
      return embedInfo;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching embed info:', error);
    }
  }
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  
  <Tip icon="shield-check">
    **Security Best Practice**: Your secret UBIK API key should never be exposed in your frontend application. The call to `/embed-info` should be made from your backend server, which can then pass the resulting short-lived `access_token` and tool details to the client.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Render the iframe">
  Once your frontend has the embedding information, you can construct the `<iframe>` URL and render it. The `access_token` from the `embed-info` endpoint must be passed as a `jwt` query parameter to the `iframe`'s source URL.

  Here is a simplified example using React:

  ```jsx React Example
  import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  const EmbeddedTool = ({ toolId }) => {
    const [embedInfo, setEmbedInfo] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
      // In a real app, this would fetch from your backend
      const fetchEmbedInfo = async () => {
        try {
          const response = await fetch(`/api/get-tool-embed-info?toolId=${toolId}`);
          const data = await response.json();
          setEmbedInfo(data);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Failed to fetch embed info:", error);
        }
      };

      fetchEmbedInfo();
    }, [toolId]);

    if (!embedInfo) {
      return <div>Loading Tool...</div>;
    }

    // Append the access token as a query parameter.
    const iframeSrc = `https://app.ubik-agent.com/embed/tools/${embedInfo.id}?jwt=${embedInfo.access_token}`;

    return (
      <iframe
        src={iframeSrc}
        title={embedInfo.name}
        width="100%"
        height="600px"
        frameBorder="0"
      />
    );
  };

  export default EmbeddedTool;
  ```

  <Note>
    **Using a direct API Key:** For scenarios where you prefer not to use the `/embed-info` endpoint (e.g., server-side rendering), you can also authenticate by passing your UBIK API key directly as the `apiKey` query parameter.
    
    `const iframeSrc = `https://app.ubik-agent.com/embed/tools/YOUR_TOOL_ID?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY`;`
    
    However, for client-side applications, using the short-lived `access_token` is strongly recommended to avoid exposing your secret API key.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Customize the Embedded Tool">
  You can customize the appearance and behavior of the embedded tool by adding query parameters to the `<iframe>` source URL.

  Here is a list of available parameters:

  - **`jwt`** (string): A short-lived JSON Web Token obtained from the `/tools/{tool_id}/embed-info` endpoint. This is the recommended method for client-side authentication.
  - **`apiKey`** (string): Your UBIK API key. This can be used for authentication instead of a JWT, but it is less secure for client-side applications as it may expose your secret key.
  - **`theme`** ('light' | 'dark'): Sets the default color theme for the tool's UI. If not provided, it defaults to the user's system preference.
  - **`showThemeToggle`** (boolean): If set to `true`, a theme toggle switch will be displayed in the tool's header, allowing users to switch between light and dark mode.
  - **`showLangToggle`** (boolean): If set to `true`, a language selector will be displayed, allowing users to change the display language.

  Example URL with customization:
  ```
  https://app.ubik-agent.com/embed/tools/YOUR_TOOL_ID?jwt=YOUR_JWT&theme=dark&showThemeToggle=true
  ```
</Step>

</Steps>

By following these steps, you can securely embed UBIK's powerful tools directly into your application, creating a seamless and integrated experience for your users.
