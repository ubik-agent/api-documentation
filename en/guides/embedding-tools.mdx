Embedding UBIK tools into your own application provides a powerful way to extend your product's capabilities. This guide will walk you through the process of securely embedding a tool using an `<iframe>`.

## Security First: Allowed Origins

To prevent unauthorized domains from embedding your tools, you must first configure a list of **Allowed Origins** for your API key. This is a critical security step.

An "origin" is the combination of a protocol, domain, and port (e.g., `https://yourapp.com`). When a request is made from an embedded iframe, UBIK will check the request's `Origin` header against the list you've configured for your API key.

You can set the allowed origins for your API keys in the user settings page on the UBIK dashboard.

## Step 1: Get Embedding Information (Server-Side)

To securely initialize the embedded tool, your application's backend must make a server-to-server call to the `GET /tools/{tool_id}/embed-info` endpoint. This endpoint provides all the necessary details, including a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) that will authenticate the iframe.

**This call must be made from your server, not from the user's browser, to keep your API key secure.**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.ubik-agent.com/api/v1/tools/YOUR_TOOL_ID/embed-info" \
     -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Origin: https://yourapp.com"
```

The response will contain the tool's details along with an `access_token`.

```json
{
  "id": "d1e2f3a4-b5c6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
  "name": "Financial Data Extractor",
  "input_schema": { ... },
  // ... other tool details
  "allowed_origins": ["https://yourapp.com"],
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

Your server should then pass this `access_token` to your frontend application.

## Step 2: Render the Iframe (Client-Side)

On your frontend, you can now construct the `<iframe>` URL. The URL should point to `https://app.ubik-agent.com/embed/tools/{tool_id}` and include the `access_token` as a URL parameter.

Here is a simple JavaScript example of how to create and append the iframe to your page:

```javascript
// This data should be fetched from your server
const embedInfo = {
  toolId: "d1e2f3a4-b5c6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
  accessToken: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
};

// Create the iframe element
const iframe = document.createElement("iframe");

// Construct the URL with the access token
const embedUrl = new URL(`https://app.ubik-agent.com/embed/tools/${embedInfo.toolId}`);
embedUrl.searchParams.append("authToken", embedInfo.accessToken);

iframe.src = embedUrl.toString();
iframe.width = "100%";
iframe.height = "600px";
iframe.style.border = "none";

// Append the iframe to a container in your document
document.getElementById("ubik-embed-container").appendChild(iframe);
```

That's it! The UBIK tool's UI will now render inside your application, fully authenticated and ready to use.
