This guide will walk you through a common workflow: creating a new workspace, adding a document to it from a URL, and then verifying that the document is correctly associated with the workspace.

## Step 1: Create a New Workspace

First, let's create a new workspace to hold our documents. We'll make a `POST` request to the `/workspaces` endpoint. You can give it a name and a description to keep things organized.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://app.ubik-agent.com/api/v1/workspaces" \
     -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
          "name": "My First Project",
          "description": "Workspace for my first project using the UBIK API."
        }'
```

The API will respond with the details of the newly created workspace, including its unique `id`. Make sure to copy this `id` for the next step.

```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
  "name": "My First Project",
  "description": "Workspace for my first project using the UBIK API.",
  "is_default": false,
  "created_at": "2025-09-29T10:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-09-29T10:00:00Z",
  "document_count": 0
}
```

## Step 2: Ingest a Document into the Workspace

Now that we have a workspace, let's add a document to it. We'll use the `/documents` endpoint to ingest content from a URL. We'll also pass the `workspace_ids` form field to associate the new document with the workspace we just created.

Replace `YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID` with the `id` you copied from the previous step.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://app.ubik-agent.com/api/v1/documents" \
     -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -F "urls=https://www.ubik-agent.com/" \
     -F "workspace_ids=YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID"
```

The API will respond with an array of document objects that have been created.

## Step 3: Verify the Document in the Workspace

Finally, let's confirm that our document has been successfully added to the workspace. We'll make a `GET` request to the `/workspaces/{workspace_id}/documents` endpoint, using the same workspace ID.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.ubik-agent.com/api/v1/workspaces/YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID/documents" \
     -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The response will be a paginated list of all documents in that workspace. You should see the document you just ingested.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "c1d2e3f4-a5b6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
      "name": "UBIK Agent",
      "file_type": "text/html",
      "status": "completed",
      "created_at": "2025-09-29T10:05:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-09-29T10:05:00Z",
      "processing_pipeline": "default-pipeline",
      "error_message": null
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 20,
  "has_more": false
}
```

<Check>
That's it! You've successfully created a workspace, added a document to it, and verified the result.
</Check>

You are now equipped to manage content organization within your UBIK projects.
