## The AI Operating System

Welcome to the UBIK API! UBIK is the missing operating system for Generative AI, designed to bridge the gap between powerful AI models and reliable, production-ready applications. Our platform unifies conversations, agents, tools, and documents into a single, modular system that empowers you to build trustworthy and useful AI agents that 10x human potential.

This documentation will provide you with everything you need to integrate UBIK's capabilities into your own applications.

## The Problem with Modern AI Integration

Organizations and developers often struggle with fragmented AI implementations that don't share knowledge or work together effectively. UBIK is designed to solve these core challenges:

  <Card title="Siloed Tools" icon="lock">
    AI tools often exist in isolation. UBIK provides a unified workflow where your AI sales pipeline can talk to your CRM, and your support agent can access your knowledge base seamlessly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prompting Fatigue" icon="rotate-ccw">
    AI models are stateless. UBIK introduces a working memory, so you don't have to repeat context in every interaction, allowing agents to resume where they left off.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limited Context" icon="file-x">
    Constantly copy-pasting between your work and AI is inefficient. UBIK allows AI to access your app's context directly, leveraging your documents, applications, and business data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Modularity" icon="puzzle">
    One-size-fits-all solutions don't scale. UBIK is built for composition, allowing you to create, share, and scale custom, industry-specific AI features.

## How UBIK Works

UBIK's core philosophy is **multistep logic**. Instead of treating AI as an unpredictable black box, we break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks. This dramatically improves the reliability, efficiency, and capability of our agents.

Our API gives you programmatic access to UBIK's core components, allowing you to:
-   **Manage Workspaces**: Organize your projects and data in high-level containers.
-   **Ingest Documents**: Feed information into the platform from files or URLs.
-   **Execute Tools**: Leverage powerful, pre-built functions to perform complex tasks.
-   **Run Agent Sessions**: Interact with stateful AI agents that maintain conversation history and context.
-   **Embed Tools**: Display UBIK's UI components directly within your own application.

## Beyond the API: The UBIK Platform

While this documentation focuses on the API, the full UBIK platform offers a rich web interface for deeper customization of your AI agents. Once you've used the API to manage your foundational resources, you can log in to the UBIK dashboard to:

-   **Define Agent Behavior**: Configure how your agent thinks and processes information through custom logic loops.
-   **Shape Agent Instructions**: Mold your agent's personality, purpose, and response guidelines.
-   **Build Custom Tools Visually**: Use our no-code editor to create and chain tools together.
