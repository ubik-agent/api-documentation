Welcome to the UBIK API! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get you up and running. You'll learn how to authenticate and make your first request to retrieve your user details.

## 1. Get your API Key

Your API key is your passport to the UBIK ecosystem. You'll need it to authenticate all of your API requests.

You can find your API key in your user settings page on the UBIK dashboard.

<Card
  title="Go to API Key Settings"
  href="https://app.ubik-agent.com/user/api-keys"
/>

Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.

## 2. Make Your First Request

Let's verify that your API key is working correctly by fetching your user details. We'll use the `/users/me` endpoint, which provides information about the authenticated user.

Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you just copied.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.ubik-agent.com/api/v1/users/me" \
     -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## 3. Check Your Response

If everything is correct, you'll receive a `200 OK` response with a JSON object containing your user information. It should look something like this:

```json
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "full_name": "Test User",
  "uuid_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
  "created_at": "2025-09-28T12:00:00Z",
  "balance": 100.0,
  "chat_session_count": 5,
  "document_count": 42,
  "workspace_count": 3,
  "assistant_count": 2
}
```
