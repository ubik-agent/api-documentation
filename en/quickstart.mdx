Welcome to the UBIK API! This guide will walk you through making your first API call in just a few minutes.

<Steps>
<Step title="Get your API Key">
  Your API key is your passport to the UBIK ecosystem. You'll need it to authenticate all of your API requests. You can find your API key in your user settings page on the UBIK dashboard.

  <Tip>
    Keep your API key secure as if it were a password and do not share it publicly.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Make Your First Request">
  Let's verify that your API key is working correctly by fetching your user details. We'll use the `/users/me` endpoint, which provides information about the authenticated user.

  <CodeGroup title="GET /users/me">
  ```bash cURL
  curl -X GET "https://app.ubik-agent.com/api/v1/users/me" \
       -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```
  ```python Python
  import requests

  api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
  headers = {
      "X-API-KEY": api_key
  }
  response = requests.get(
      "https://app.ubik-agent.com/api/v1/users/me",
      headers=headers
  )
  print(response.json())
  ```
  ```javascript JavaScript
  const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
  const headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": apiKey,
  };

  fetch("https://app.ubik-agent.com/api/v1/users/me", {
    method: "GET",
    headers: headers,
  })
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => console.log(data))
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Check the Response">
  If everything is correct, you'll receive a `200 OK` response with a JSON object containing your user details.

  ```json Response
  {
    "username": "testuser",
    "full_name": "Test User",
    "uuid_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
    "created_at": "2025-09-28T12:00:00Z",
    "balance": 100.0,
    "chat_session_count": 5,
    "document_count": 42,
    "workspace_count": 3,
    "assistant_count": 2
  }
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>
