To make the most of the UBIK API, it's helpful to understand the key concepts that you'll be working with. This guide introduces the core components of our platform.

## Workspaces

Think of a **Workspace** as a high-level container for your projects. It's the primary way to organize and segregate your data. Each workspace can contain its own set of documents, tools, and assistants.

- **Organization**: Group related documents for a specific project, team, or customer.
- **Isolation**: Data within one workspace is kept separate from others, ensuring privacy and control.
- **Default Workspace**: Every user has a default workspace where new documents are added if no other workspace is specified.

<Info>You can manage your workspaces through the [`/workspaces`](/en/api-reference/public-api/list-workspaces) endpoints.</Info>

## Documents

A **Document** represents any piece of content you ingest into the UBIK platform. This could be a file you upload (like a PDF or `.txt` file) or a web page you scrape. Once ingested, documents are processed and stored, making them ready to be used by Tools.

## Tools

A **Tool** is a specialized function that performs a specific, complex task. Tools are designed to be powerful and asynchronous, allowing you to execute long-running jobs without blocking your application.

Examples include:
- Extracting financial data from a report.
- Summarizing a long legal document.
- Answering questions based on the content of multiple documents.

You can discover and execute tools using the [`/tools`](/en/api-reference/public-api/list-available-tools) endpoints.
