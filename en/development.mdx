To make the most of the UBIK API, it's helpful to understand the key concepts that you'll be working with. This guide introduces the core components of our platform.

## Workspaces

Think of a **Workspace** as a high-level container for your projects. It's the primary way to organize and segregate your data. Each workspace can contain its own set of documents, tools, and assistants.

- **Organization**: Group related documents for a specific project, team, or customer.
- **Isolation**: Data within one workspace is kept separate from others, ensuring privacy and control.
- **Default Workspace**: Every user has a default workspace where new documents are added if no other workspace is specified.

You can manage your workspaces through the [`/workspaces`](/en/api-reference/introduction#tag/Public-API-Workspaces) endpoints.

## Documents

A **Document** is the fundamental unit of content in UBIK. It represents any piece of data that you ingest into the system, whether it's from a file upload (like a PDF or text file) or a scraped URL.

- **Ingestion**: UBIK can process a wide variety of file types and online content.
- **Processing**: Once ingested, documents go through a processing pipeline where content is extracted, converted to Markdown, and indexed for retrieval.
- **Association**: Documents can be associated with one or more workspaces, allowing for flexible content management.

Explore what you can do with documents via the [`/documents`](/en/api-reference/introduction#tag/Public-API-Documents) endpoints.

## Tools

**Tools** are one of the most powerful features of the UBIK API. They are pre-built, specialized agents that can perform complex tasks on your data.

- **Functionality**: A tool can do anything from extracting specific financial data from a report to summarizing a long article.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Tools run asynchronously. You start an execution, and the API returns an `execution_id` that you can use to poll for the results.
- **Extensibility**: The list of available tools is constantly growing, enabling you to add powerful new capabilities to your applications with minimal effort.

Discover and execute tools using the [`/tools`](/en/api-reference/introduction#tag/Public-API-Tools) and [`/tool-executions`](/en/api-reference/introduction#tag/Public-API-Tool-Executions) endpoints.
